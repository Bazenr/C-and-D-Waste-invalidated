# Rapid generation method for the dataset of stacked construction solid waste

Stacked C&amp;D waste dataset
The dataset contain 4 types of construction solid waste: **concrete**, **brick**, **wood** and **rubber**.
Each document countains 25 sample images and label files.

**"auto"** means the dataset was **automatically labeled** using OpenCV according to height images. And the labels are correct, since all objects in one image must belong to the **same category**. The folder **"color"**, **"height"** and **"json"** represent **RGB**, **height** images and **label** files.

**"cp"** means the dataset was **automatically copy-pasted** according to the data in corresponding **"auto"** dataset.

**"manual"** means the dataset was **labeled manually** by us.

**"test"** means the dataset was **labeled manually** by us for **model test**. The images never appear in other files.
